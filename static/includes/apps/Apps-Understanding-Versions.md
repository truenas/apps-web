There are two version numbers for the selected application: **App Version** and **Version**:

* **App Version** is the version of the upstream Docker image the app installs, such as *24.04.10.2.1* for Collabora.
  The **App Version** also appears in the **Application Info** widget on the **Installed** applications screen.

* **Version** is the revision number of the app in the [TrueNAS app train](https://github.com/truenas/apps/tree/master/trains), for example *1.2.2*.
  The **Version** is the number used to identify app updates in TrueNAS.
  It also appears on the **Installed** applications screen, on the **Discover** screen app widget, and in the install wizard for the app.
